## Deployment

**For complete deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Quick Deploy to Subdomain (learn-apt.iiskills.cloud)

This application is configured to run on the exclusive subdomain `learn-apt.iiskills.cloud`. Follow these steps for deployment:

#### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **One-Click Deploy**

   [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/phildass/learn-apt)

2. **Or Deploy via Vercel CLI**

   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm i -g vercel
   
   # Login to Vercel
   vercel login
   
   # Deploy to production
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Configure Custom Subdomain**

   After deployment:
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Navigate to "Domains"
   - Add `learn-apt.iiskills.cloud`
   - Update your DNS records as instructed by Vercel

#### Option 2: Deploy to Your Own Server

1. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or use PM2 for process management:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   ```

3. **Configure Nginx (if applicable)**

   Example Nginx configuration for the subdomain:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name learn-apt.iiskills.cloud;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Enable HTTPS with Let's Encrypt**

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d learn-apt.iiskills.cloud
   ```

### Environment Variables

The application requires Supabase configuration for authentication:

1. **Create `.env.local` file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Configure Supabase credentials**:
   - Get credentials from the main iiskills-cloud Supabase project
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - See [SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md](./SUPABASE_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed setup instructions

3. **Important**: Use the **SAME** Supabase project as the main iiskills-cloud repository to enable cross-subdomain authentication.
