# Restoring the copilot/check-module-question-distribution Branch

## Problem

The branch `copilot/check-module-question-distribution` from PR #15 was merged into `main` but subsequently deleted from the remote repository. This prevents collaborators and deploy agents from accessing the branch for review, deployment, or other purposes.

## Solution

Two methods are provided to restore the branch:

### Method 1: GitHub Actions Workflow (Recommended)

A GitHub Actions workflow has been created to automate the branch restoration process.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Go to the "Actions" tab
3. Select "Restore Branch" from the workflows list on the left
4. Click "Run workflow" button
5. Verify the pre-filled values:
   - **Branch name**: `copilot/check-module-question-distribution`
   - **Commit SHA**: `e8c240fecd30051b0244efc09e060ebf76ac97e9`
6. Click the green "Run workflow" button
7. Wait for the workflow to complete (usually less than 1 minute)
8. The branch will be restored to the remote repository

**Advantages:**
- No local setup required
- Uses GitHub's built-in authentication
- Provides a clear success/failure status
- Can be run by anyone with write access to the repository

### Method 2: Manual Script

A bash script is provided for local execution.

**Prerequisites:**
- Git repository cloned locally
- Push permissions to the repository
- Authenticated git client (via SSH keys or HTTPS token)

**Steps:**

1. Ensure you're in the repository root directory
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x restore-branch.sh
   ./restore-branch.sh
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Fetch the commit from the remote
   - Create the branch locally at the specified commit
   - Push the branch to the remote repository

**Script Location:** `restore-branch.sh` in the repository root

## Additional Notes

- The commit `e8c240fecd30051b0244efc09e060ebf76ac97e9` is the final commit from PR #15 before it was merged
- This commit includes all the changes from the PR
- Restoring the branch does not affect the `main` branch or any other branches
- The restored branch can be used for reference, deployment, or further development

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Authentication failed" error
- **Solution:** Ensure you have push permissions and are properly authenticated

**Issue:** "Branch already exists" warning
- **Solution:** This is expected if the branch was already created locally. The script will continue to push it.

**Issue:** GitHub Actions workflow not visible
- **Solution:** The workflow file must be merged to the default branch first. Push this PR and then run the workflow from the Actions tab.
